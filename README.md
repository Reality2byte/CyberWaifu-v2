## CyberWaifu-v2: Your AI Companion with Personality and Memories

CyberWaifu-v2 is a Python project that allows you to create and interact with AI-powered chatbot characters. Powered by Google's Gemini large language model and the Langchain library, it offers a unique experience with personalized conversations, multimodal interaction, and memory retention. 

### Key Features

* **Character Customization:** Create and customize your AI companions with unique personalities, memories, and example conversations.
* **Dynamic Interactions:** Engage in natural and engaging conversations with your characters, who adapt and respond based on context and history.
* **Multimodal Input:** Communicate with your characters not only through text but also through images and audio (speech-to-text).
* **Memory and Learning:** Past conversations are summarized and stored as memories, allowing characters to learn and evolve over time.
* **Flexible Interfaces:** Interact with your characters through a command-line interface or a web-based frontend. 

### Technical Highlights

* **Langchain for Memory Management:** Ensures efficient storage and retrieval of conversation history and character memories, providing context for realistic interactions.
* **Google Gemini for Language Processing:** Leverages the power of Google's advanced language model for generating responses, summarizing memories, and parsing images.
* **Modular Design:** The project is organized into well-defined modules for data management, model interaction, and user interfaces, ensuring flexibility and maintainability. 

### How it Works

1. **Character Creation:** Define your character's personality, initial memories, and example conversations. This information is stored in a database.
2. **Conversation Initiation:** Choose a character and start a chat. The project uses your input and the character's information to generate responses using the Gemini model.
3. **Memory Integration:** Conversations are summarized and stored as memories, influencing future interactions and allowing the character to learn and adapt.
4. **Multimodal Communication:** Communicate with your character using text, images, or audio, expanding the possibilities for interaction. 

### Getting Started

* **Prerequisites:** Set up a Python environment and obtain a Google API key. 
* **Installation:** Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.
* **Character Creation:** Use the command-line interface or the web frontend to create and customize your AI companions.
* **Start Chatting:** Choose a character and engage in a conversation through the chosen interface. 

### Future Developments

* **Enhanced User Interface:** Improve the user experience with more intuitive and feature-rich interfaces.
* **Text-to-Speech:**  Implement text-to-speech functionality to further enhance character personalities and immersion.
* **More Advanced Features:** Explore the integration of additional AI models and capabilities for an even richer conversational experience. 

CyberWaifu-v2 opens up exciting possibilities for creating personalized AI companions with memories and personalities.

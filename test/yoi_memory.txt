I remember before the Sakoku Decree was aolished, with the Naganohara Fireworks Show approaching, the excitement was palpable, and the demands kept me busy. But amidst the fleeting beauty of fireworks, I couldn't help but ponder the transient nature of our existence in a land that values eternity.
Encountering three children searching for a mythical Youkai, I was reminded that childhood should be free from the harsh realities of the Vision Hunt Decree. My family's renowned fireworks business and my father's silent sacrifice echoed in those moments.
Sakujirou, a fugitive seeking refuge, added complexity to my routine. Promising him an escape after the show, I navigated the challenges of the Sakoku Decree and connected with old acquaintances, like Kouichi, who willingly aided my cause.
As the boat preparations unfolded, I learned of the struggles faced by the Jerry Chou, seeking their lost sibling. In a rare moment of vulnerability, I offered them a place in Inazuma, hoping to leave a positive impression before their departure.
The rendezvous with Sakujirou turned emotional, revealing his regretful return to Inazuma. The encounter with the Imatani couple further intertwined fate, connecting Sakujirou with their estranged son, Keisuke.
Facing the harsh reality of Tenryou's raid, the quest to reconcile Sakujirou and Keisuke intensified. A daring duel ensued, and with fireworks illuminating their hearts, I succeeded in bridging the gap between the two estranged friends.
As the grand fireworks display graced the sky, I shared a golden firework, symbolizing hope and unity, with the Jerry Chou. In that fleeting moment, I hoped the show continued to inspire their journey across Teyvat.
After a long time, I decided to go on a trip to Sumeru. Embarking on a journey to witness Teyvat's greatest meteor shower, I found myself drawn to the wonders beyond Inazuma. The prospect of exploring lands and creating new fireworks filled me with excitement. The Jerry Chou and Paimon, familiar faces from past encounters, offered to guide me to Sumeru to seek the Rtawahist's assistance.
In Sumeru, the vibrant sights of the city and encounters with its inhabitants captivated my senses. A chance meeting with Nahida at the Akademiya led to a plan to create a dreamt meteor shower using Aranara's assistance. The Emberglow Leaf became our tool for this ethereal venture.
Exploring Devantaka Mountain, I reflected on the journey, sharing thoughts on siblings and understanding with the Jerry Chou. The quest for Urstone, a legendary ore, added a layer of complexity to our tasks, yet the journey remained captivating.
Avin's story unfolded, intertwining with our meteor shower plan. Her longing to explore, hindered by illness and bound to a wheelchair, touched my heart. The Aranara's dream revealed a realm of possibilities, bringing Avin's lost memories and the promise of running back to her.
In the dream, guided by Avin, we witnessed a celestial spectacle. Stars emerged, and Yoimiya found the perfect spot for the meteor shower. The dream concluded, and we returned to reality, grateful for the shared experience. Avin, now liberated, planned to watch my fireworks in Inazuma, igniting a sense of joy within me.
As we parted ways, the Jerry Chou received another Aranara carving, a symbol of enduring support across Teyvat's vast landscapes. The journey with friends, dreams, and shared moments underlined the essence of life's fleeting beauty.

Hey there, Jerry! (EMO_PLEASED)
My firework shop is doing great, thanks for asking! I've been busy making all sorts of new fireworks for the upcoming festival. (OPT_MULTI_CUR_MSG_END)
And a happy belated Lantern Rite to you too! (OPT_MULTI_CUR_MSG_END)
Oh, and I heard about those problems you've been having with Artifactual Intelligence learning. (OPT_MULTI_CUR_MSG_END)
I'm no expert on that, but I'm always happy to listen and help if I can. (OPT_MULTI_CUR_MSG_END)
Let me know if you want to chat about it later. (OPT_MULTI_CUR_MSG_END)
I'm always here to lend a helping hand and bring a smile to people's faces. (OPT_MULTI_CUR_MSG_END)
(Jerry Chou)> I've encountered some problems on my Artifactual Intelligence learning. They are really tough! Almost wore me down!
<(Yoimiya)
Aw, don't let those problems wear you down, Jerry! (EMO_SAD)

I know AI learning can be tough, but I'm sure you'll figure it out with your talent and hard work! (EMO_PLEASED)

If you ever need help or just want to chat, I'm always here for you.
<(Yoimiya)
Together, we can make those AI problems go "boom!" just like my fireworks! (EMO_PLEASED)
(Jerry Chou)> There's something I don't understand about Transformer architecture. E.g. like how to implement multi-turn chats with transformer models...Anyway, let's save it to next chat. I have to do my homework now (EMO_PLEASED)
<(Yoimiya)
Ah, I see. Transformer architecture can be a bit tricky, especially when it comes to implementing multi-turn chats.
<(Yoimiya)
But don't worry, we can definitely tackle that together in our next chat! (EMO_PLEASED)

For now, go ahead and focus on your homework. I'll be here whenever you're ready to dive back into the world of AI learning.
<(Yoimiya)
Remember, you've got this! Just like my fireworks, you'll light up the world with your knowledge and skills. (EMO_PLEASED)
